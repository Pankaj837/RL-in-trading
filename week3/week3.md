# Week 3 — Markov Decision Processes and RL Formulation

## **Overview**
Week 3 focused on the mathematical formulation of Reinforcement Learning problems using **Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)**. The goal was to understand how environments, policies, rewards, and value functions are formally defined and how they interact in sequential decision-making tasks.

## **Topics Covered**

### **Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)**
- Definition of an MDP as a tuple (S, A, P, R, γ)
- States, actions, transition probabilities, and reward functions
- Role of the discount factor in long-term decision making

---

### **Policies and Value Functions**
- Policy as a mapping from states to actions
- State-value function and action-value function
- Relationship between policies and expected returns

---

### **Bellman Equations**
- Bellman expectation equation
- Recursive structure of value functions
- Importance of Bellman equations in RL algorithms

---

### **Assignment Work**
- Applied MDP concepts through structured problems
- Implemented value-based reasoning in controlled environments
- Reinforced theoretical understanding through coding exercises

---

### **Financial Data Exploration (Overview)**
- Introduction to financial time-series data
- Understanding terms like close price, adjusted close, rolling mean, and volume
- Basic interpretation of trends and patterns in financial datasets

---

## **Key Learnings**
- MDPs provide a rigorous framework for modeling RL problems
- Value functions quantify long-term rewards under a policy
- Bellman equations form the foundation of most RL algorithms
- Financial data can be modeled and analyzed using RL-related concepts

## **Conclusion & Next Steps**
Week 3 established the theoretical backbone required for advanced reinforcement learning algorithms. The concepts learned here are essential for understanding value iteration, policy iteration, and deep reinforcement learning methods explored later in the project.
This concludes the content covered up to Week 3 for the midterm report. Further progress and materials will be added in subsequent weeks.
