RL-in-Trading (WiDS)

This repository contains my work for the WiDS project on Reinforcement Learning in Trading.

The goal of this project is to understand reinforcement learning from the basics, implement core algorithms step by step, and slowly connect these ideas to decision-making and trading-related problems.

Instead of rushing to complex models, the project is structured week by week, focusing on learning concepts properly and implementing them in a clean and understandable way.

How this repository is organised

The repository is divided into three main weeks:

Week1/  → Python & core libraries  
Week2/  → Reinforcement Learning basics (Bandits)  
Week3/  → Markov Decision Processes & RL formulation


Each week contains:

A weekly README (WeekX.md) written in my own words

Notebooks (.ipynb) for learning, experiments, and observations

Scripts (.py) for clean implementations of algorithms

Datasets (.csv) used during that week (if any)

How I am working on this project

I do not copy-paste code or explanations

I first learn the concept, then write it in my own way

Notebooks are used to experiment and understand

Scripts contain clean, reusable logic

Weekly READMEs focus on what I learned and understood, not textbook definitions

This approach helps me build strong fundamentals and genuinely understand reinforcement learning instead of just running code.

Weekly progress

Week 1: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

Week 2: Introduction to Reinforcement Learning & Multi-Armed Bandits

Week 3: Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and mathematical formulation of RL

Each week is documented separately inside its folder.

Note

This repository reflects a learning process, not a finished product.
The focus is on clarity, understanding, and gradual improvement.
