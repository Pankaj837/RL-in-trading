# Week 1 — Python and Core Libraries

## Overview

Week 1 focused on building a strong foundation required for the Reinforcement Learning in Trading project. The aim of this week was to become comfortable with Python programming and the core libraries used for numerical computation, data handling, and visualization. These skills are essential for implementing and understanding reinforcement learning algorithms in later weeks.


## Topics Covered

### Python Basics

* Basic syntax and data types
* Lists, strings, and dictionaries
* Conditional statements and loops
* Functions and basic problem-solving
* Writing and running Python scripts

Simple practice problems were solved to improve logical thinking and familiarity with Python.


### NumPy

* Creating and working with NumPy arrays
* Indexing and slicing
* Element-wise operations
* Basic mathematical and statistical functions
* Understanding why NumPy is faster and more efficient than Python lists

An assignment notebook was used to practice array operations and numerical computation.


### Pandas

* Understanding tabular data using DataFrames
* Loading CSV files
* Inspecting datasets using basic functions
* Simple data manipulation operations

Pandas was introduced as a key tool for handling datasets that will be used later in trading-related tasks.

### Matplotlib

* Creating basic plots such as line plots and histograms
* Labeling plots and saving figures
* Using visualization to understand data distributions

Matplotlib was used both independently and together with Pandas.

## Assignments / Problems Worked On

* Python practice problems involving arrays, strings, and conditionals
* NumPy assignment focused on array operations
* Pandas and Matplotlib notebook for basic data analysis and plotting

These tasks helped in applying theoretical concepts through hands-on coding.

## Key Learnings

* Python is the backbone language for reinforcement learning workflows
* NumPy enables efficient numerical computation required for RL algorithms
* Pandas simplifies working with structured datasets
* Visualization helps in understanding data patterns and distributions
* Writing and running small programs improves problem-solving ability

## Conclusion & Next Steps

Week 1 successfully established the programming and data-handling foundation needed for the project. With these basics in place, the next step is to move towards reinforcement learning concepts and decision-making problems.

In **Week 2**, the focus will shift to understanding reinforcement learning fundamentals through the multi-armed bandit problem and implementing basic RL algorithms.

When you’re ready, we’ll move to **Week 1 problem solutions** (writing the actual code), and then follow the **same structure for Week 2 and Week 3**.
